# octrees-benchmark

## Background

LiDAR (Light and Ranging Detection) technology has now become the quintessential technique for collecting geospatial data from the earth's surface. This code implements a linearized octree based on ideas from Keller et al. and Behley et al. for fast fixed-radius neighbourhood searches, achieving better performance than other Octrees and KD-trees tested, such as nanoflann KD-tree, picoTree, PCL Octree and KD-Tree, and unibnOctree. We also analyze the performance of Morton and Hilbert Space Filling Curves (SFCs). SFC Reordering allows for faster searches and is essential for the construction of the linear Octree. Extensive benchmarking and result plotting code and scripts are also provided.
		
## Installation

### Dependencies
- LASTools:
    First we need the dependencies, listed at https://github.com/LAStools/LAStools:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libjpeg62 libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjpeg-dev libz-dev libproj-dev liblzma-dev libjbig-dev libzstd-dev libgeotiff-dev libwebp-dev liblzma-dev libsqlite3-dev
    ```

    Now we clone the repo and build:
    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/LAStools/LAStools lib/LAStools
    (cd lib/LAStools && cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/../LASlib . && cmake --build build -- -j && cmake --install build)
    rm -rf lib/LAStools
    ```
    
- PCL version 1.15 (Optional) 
    Get 1.15 source code from  `https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases` and build it. The folder were we installed it is `~/local/pcl`, but that can be changed to any other folder, with an appropiate change in `CMakeLibraries.cmake`. Can also change the version to look for in that file.
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases/download/pcl-1.15.0/source.tar.gz
    tar xvf source.tar.gz
    cd pcl && mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local/pcl -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make -j2
    make -j2 install
    ```
    If PCL is not found during compilation, code will compile just fine, but without support for PCL Octree and KD-Tree related benchmarks.

- PAPI (Optional, for cache profiling)
  ```bash
    wget https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/papi/releases/download/papi-7-2-0-t/papi-7.2.0.tar.gz -P lib
    tar xvf lib/papi-7.2.0.tar.gz -C lib && rm lib/papi-7.2.0.tar.gz && mv lib/papi-7.2.0 lib/papi/
    (cd lib/papi/src && ./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/.. && make -j && make install)
  ```

### Compilation

In the project directory, just execute
  ```bash
  cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
  cmake --build build
  ```

This creates the executable at `build/octrees-benchmark`.

### Execution
We provide scripts for replicating our results, check `bench_neighbors.bash` for kNN and fixed-radius neighbor searches, `bench_memory.bash` for the measurements of Octree and KD-tree sizes, and `bench_locality.bash` for benchmarks analyzing how SFCs improve locality.

Under the folder `plots` we include all the python scripts for generating the figures seen in the publication.

### Tests / Examples

A small usage example of the library features is provided under `tests/example.cpp`. It is automatically built alongside the main project.

```bash
make test_library
./tests/test_library
```

#### Running the full test suite

The project includes a comprehensive unit testing suite using GoogleTest. Build the project with option -DBUILD_TESTS=ON to enable it. After building the project, you can run all tests with:

```bash
make                # builds the library and all test executables
ctest --output-on-failure
```

You can also run individual test executables directly, e.g.:

```bash
./tests/test_points
./tests/test_encoders
./tests/test_octree
./tests/test_octree_advanced
```

To run a specific test case with CTest, use the `-R` option with the test name, for example:

```bash
ctest -R LinearOctreeTest.RadiusSearch
```
